# Installation
RDSim is a tool for simulating rare disease patient genotypes and phenotypes. It provides a user-facing bash script (script/RDSim.sh) to run different simulation workflows. Before installing RDSim, make sure ProxyTyper is installed (https://github.com/harmancilab/ProxyTyper/tree/main/installation), as it is required for simulating patient genotypes.

# Steps to Install and Run RDSim Using Docker
## Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xhwang2017/RDSim.git
cd RDSim
```

## Step 2: Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t rdsim .
```
This tool requires Python, PLINK 2, and BCFtools to be installed. 

## Step 3: Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -it rdsim bash
```

## Step 4: Navigate to the Script Directory

```bash
cd script
```

## Step5: Run RDSim Commands
The main RDSim commands and options include:
