# Installation
RDSim is a tool for simulating rare disease patient genotypes and phenotypes. It provides a user-facing bash script (script/RDSim.sh) to run different simulation workflows. 
Before installing RDSim, make sure ProxyTyper is installed (https://github.com/harmancilab/ProxyTyper/tree/main/installation), as it is required for simulating patient genotypes.
