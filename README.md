# RDSim
RDSim is a Python package designed to simulate the genotypes and phenotypes of rare disease patients. This package can be used by researchers and student to generate synthetic data for studying the relationship between specific genetic mutations and the phenotypic manifestations associated with rare diseases.

# Features
Genotypes Simulation: Generate synthetic genotypes with user-defined mutation rates for specific genes.
Phenotype Simulation: Map genotypic variations to observable characteristics (phenotypes) based on predefined disease models.
Disease Models: Supports custom models linking genes to symptoms, enabling flexible simulations for various rare diseases.
Synthetic Data: Generate data for testing and validating algorithms or understanding disease-gene relationships.

# Installation
To install RDSim, youâ€™ll need Python 3.6 or higher. Install via pip:

bash\
Copy code\
pip install git+https://github.com/xhwang2017/RDSim.git

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install it locally:

bash\
Copy code\
git clone https://github.com/xhwang2017/RDSim.git
cd RDSim\
pip install .

# Usage
After installation, you can start using the package to simulate genotype and phenotype data for rare disease patients.
